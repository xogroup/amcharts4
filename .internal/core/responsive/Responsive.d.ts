/**
 * Responsive is responsible for overriding certain properties when conditions
 * are met.
 *
 * This class is used to dynamically apply and change certain chart properties
 * based on the current values of properties.
 *
 * Mainly, this is used with [[Sprite]]'s dimensional properties, like
 * `pixelWidth` and `pixelHeight`. However, it can be used to dynamically
 * change any property, based on any other property's value.
 *
 * A default responsive rules are disabled.
 *
 * To enable, set `enabled = false`. E.g.:
 *
 * ```TypeScript
 * chart.responsive.enabled = true;
 * ```
 * ```JavaScript
 * chart.responsive.enabled = true;
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link IResponsiveEvents} for a list of available events
